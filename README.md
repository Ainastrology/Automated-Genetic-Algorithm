# Automated-Genetic-Algorithm
This Project" Automation of Realizing Data Set for Line Slope Equation using Genetic Algorithm" utilizes the concept of mutation and crossover technique to determine which generation has lowest fitness error(most fittest) .It also compares new inherited generations from previous ones and return those with lowest fitness error.
So basically This automation is performed in java programming language to provide a different and unique concept for this Automated Programming Algorithm .


# What does it actually do ?
This project " Automation of Realizing Data Set for Line Slope Equation using Genetic Algorithm" utilizes the concept of mutation and crossover techniques over the various generations with specific population size to determine which generation has lowest fitness error(most fittest) .It also compares new inherited generations from the previous generation continuing with a specific population size and return those generations which have the lowest fitness error.Similarly , it checks for differents data points provided for line equation and checks which data point is most fitted and then perform crossover and mutation techniques on them to create new data points from the previous one and it will return that data point for line slope equation which is the most fittest as thath point will be closer to our actual result.


# Genetic Algorithm is mainly comprised of ?
As we all know that Genetic Algorithm works on the principle of human genes and chromosomes. However, Genetic Algorithm stops working after many crossovers and mutations.Moreover, coming back to our question this " Automation of Realizing Data Set for Line Slope Equation using Genetic Algorithm " comprises of :
# Selection: 
Individuals from the population are selected based on their fitness, which indicates how well they solve the problem at hand. The fitter individuals have a higher chance of being selected for reproduction.
# Crossover: 
Selected individuals combine their genetic material to create offspring. This process is analogous to genetic recombination in nature and helps explore new areas of the search space.
# Mutation: 
Random changes are introduced to the genetic material of the offspring to add diversity and prevent premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.

By iteratively repeating these steps, a genetic algorithm explores the search space, converging towards an optimal solution over time.

# Automated-Genetic-Algorithm
This Project" Automation of Realizing Data Set for Line Slope Equation using Genetic Algorithm" utilizes the concept of mutation and crossover technique to determine which generation has lowest fitness error(most fittest) .It also compares new inherited generations from previous ones and return those with lowest fitness error.
